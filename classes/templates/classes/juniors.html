                                Our junior classes are perfect for children aged 6 – 13 years old. They will have fun and meet other children with similar interests, whilst burning away that abundance of energy before bed time. Between the foods we eat and the constant sitting and staring into screens and devices, many kids are not getting enough regular exercise.

                                Our martial arts classes for kids are full exercise routines disguised as a boatload of fun! That is because they are jam packed with activities, games and drills that are all designed to disguise the repetition of training. Children who are new to taekwondo will be taught the basics like how to block, strike, punch and kick. Then they work through the syllabus with our instructors, they will be taught more advanced techniques and patterns to progress.

                            Every parent’s paramount concern is their children’s safety, so we include safety orientated lessons that focus on topics such as dealing with bullies and strangers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We never want our kids to have to use these skills in modern life, but every good parent still wants their kids to be safe. That’s why our martial arts training is very serious about teaching your kids the skills needed for self-protection in any circumstance, from the neighbourhood bully to a stranger on the street (and so much more). But knowing how to defend oneself is only half the battle. Our classes teach your child the respect and self-discipline needed to diffuse a situation without violence whenever possible – as well as the knowledge to know when force is the only way to safety.

                            This really depends on how old and mature the child is. The honest answer is, we prefer for parents to stay and watches. We have found that  if parents are not present its very difficult for them to understand what the child has to learn to achieve the next belt, it also makes the getting sparring equipment on and off a little easier.

                            <p>Your sparring equipment consists of head guard, gloves, foot guards, shin pads, gum shield, and either a groin guard (Boys &amp; Men) or breast protectors (ladies). Due to the volume of equipment a bag to hold them in is suggested.</p>

                            <p>Grading for belts is purely optional. The belt system sets goals for students and encourages them to learn new things and face fresh challenges. However, if a student does not wish to grade, we will still be happy for them to train with us.</p>
                            <p>There are 4 coloured belt gradings a year. Every March, June, September and December.</p>
