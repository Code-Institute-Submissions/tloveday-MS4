                                Studying martial arts is something that anybody – at any age or fitness level – can do. Martial arts classes are fun, empowering, and provide a great workout for all ages. Whether you want to defend yourself, lose weight, or just have fun, our senior martial arts classes have something to offer.

                                Even when you do find time to hit the gym, regardless of having a schedule that’s full of work, family time, and other obligations, you might be bored by your same old workout. There’s nothing exciting about another go-round on the treadmill or elliptical – and you might need some encouragement to stick to a schedule and achieve your fitness goals. Martial arts classes for adults focus on building core strength and cardiovascular fitness in a fun, social setting. Why not break out of your dull routine?

                            Our Senior class encompasses everything found in our juniors class but with the adults instead. We teach all the basic, intermediate and advanced techniques in order to give you the skills to make you a rounded Martial Artist and on the road to eventually earning a Black Belt, which is only the first chapter on the journey.

                            It is common for teens and adults to struggle with self-esteem as they deal with competitive work and educational environments and overloaded to-do lists. Adults who study martial arts learn to search within themselves for their best qualities. They learn to self-motivate and not to worry what others think of them. Martial arts instruction encourages students to feel good about themselves as they master new techniques.
